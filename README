This is an simple LISP-interpreter witten in Ruby.
Given a Lisp Expression like this:

  (+ (* 3 4) 2)

the Lexer will produce:

  [:+ [:* 3 4] 2]

Ruby symbols are LISP atoms and arrays are lists.

The interpreter evals the whole list and executes the apply method
on the functions.

The build-in functions are the functions that are attached to the interpreter
class. To bootstrapp the interpreter the Core and Math modules (of helper.rb)
are included in the interpreter class. This makes Ruby integration rather
simple.

Start the Interpreter using this scheme:

	l = Lisp::Lexer.new
	p = Lisp::Parser.new
	l.tokenize("test.lisp", p)
	i = Lisp::Interpreter.new
	i.start p.node
